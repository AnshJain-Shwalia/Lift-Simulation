# Lift-Simulation

This project is a Lift Simulator that, upon receiving the number of floors and lifts as input, generates an interface with the corresponding number of lifts and floors. This simulator demonstrates the lift movements in response to button presses.

In this version, each elevator has an up and down button on every floor, and the elevator whose button is pressed
responds to the call.
